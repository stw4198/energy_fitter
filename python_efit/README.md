This fitter is designed to work with the file format of the WATCHMAN vertex fitter FRED. It will calculate a fit between an energy estimator and the true energy and apply the fit to calculate energy resolution.

The plotting script is for testing purposes only and is not final.

Usage:

python3 energyfit.py {Reconstructed_file}.root {options}

Use --h option to display input options.
