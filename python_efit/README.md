This fitter is designed to work with the file format of the WATCHMAN vertex fitter [FRED](https://github.com/AIT-WATCHMAN/FRED.git). It will calculate a fit between an energy estimator and the true energy and apply the fit to calculate energy resolution.

The plotting scripts and parameter writer are additions for visualisation and applying result to file for use in FRED. They are not final.

Usage:

python3 energyfit.py {Reconstructed_file}.root {options}

Use --h option to display input options.
